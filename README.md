# FNAF1-Reimaginated
Idk, I got this idea suddenly although I don't have too knowledge about programming, so if someone want help, contact me in: lokiwallestein@gmail.com

The idea is the follow:
â€¢ Use the FNAF Original Source Code and modifies it to make possible my idea that includes:
1. Real Time Nights (6 hours per night)
2. Save and Auto-Save System for no lose your night progresses.
3. Create a system of missions that realizes as long the night passes.
4. Add content relative to FNAF lore (I'm thinking in the creator of VHS Series for this).
5. Add more functions as security guard and don't have to only sit down and check cameras.
6. No lucrative content, of course. And give to Scott Cawthon all the credits for this work.

If you're interested in the project, contact me in my email.
